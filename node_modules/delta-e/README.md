# DeltaE - Quantify Color Difference

Check out the following GitHub Pages respository for information on this library.

http://zschuessler.github.io/DeltaE/

## About Delta E

This package gives access to three color difference algorithms. 
These algorithms represent the hard work of the [International Commission on Illumination (CIE).](http://www.cie.co.at/)


Historically, each iterative algorithm has been used in print
and textile industries to maintain consistency in machine calibration.
These days, far more interesting use cases arise with media processing.
    
## Install It

DeltaE comes in flavors of npm and Bower.

    // install via npm
    npm install delta-e

    // install via Bower
    bower install delta-e

### Use It
    // For npm: use require
    var DeltaE = require('delta-e');

    // For Bower: include the script. DeltaE global now accessible.
    <script src="bower_components/delta-e/dist/deltae.global.min.js"></script>

    // Create two test LAB color objects to compare!
    var color1 = {L: 36, A: 60, B: 41};
    var color2 = {L: 100, A: 40, B: 90};
    
    // 1976 formula
    console.log(DeltaE.getDeltaE76(color1, color2));
    
    // 1994 formula
    console.log(DeltaE.getDeltaE94(color1, color2));
    
    // 2000 formula
    console.log(DeltaE.getDeltaE00(color1, color2));

## Tests

A simple Mocha test is setup to test the accuracy of each dE algorithm, for both
npm and Bower versions.

    $ cd tests/
    $ mocha main.js

## Gulp Tasks

### build

Builds both the Bower and npm version from source.

    $ gulp build

### jsdoc

Generates full documentation in the /jsdoc/ folder.

    $ gulp jsdoc
