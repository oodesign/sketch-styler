# Sketch Styler (Sketch plugin)

Styler is a Sketch plugin that assigns styles automatically to all of your unstyled layers. 

‚ö†Ô∏è <b>This plugin is discontinued</b>. It may continue to work on some projects, but we discourage using it for production work.

We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you.

## Assign Styles Automatically

Styler scans your Sketch files for unstyled layers and looks which of the existing styles (in the file or in linked libraries) matches for them.

## How does it work?

Define which style attributes you want Styler to consider to find matching styles.

Styler will analyze every unstyled layer in your Sketch file and look for styles that have the same attributes.

Once the analysis is completed you‚Äôll be able to decide which styles may be applied and which not. After that you just need to hit "Assign styles" and let the magic happen üé©!

## What about layer styles?
Layer styles are coming soon! Stay tuned!
