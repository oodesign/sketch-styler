Styler is a Sketch plugin that assigns styles automatically to all of your unstyled layers. Find all details on www.sketchstyler.com. 



Assign Styles Automatically
Styler scans your Sketch files for unstyled layers and looks which of the existing styles (in the file or in linked libraries) matches for them.



How does it work?
Define which style attributes you want Styler to consider to find matching styles.

Styler will analyze every unstyled layer in your Sketch file and look for styles that have the same attributes.

Once the analysis is completed youâ€™ll be able to decide which styles may be applied and which not. After that you just need to hit "Assign styles" and let the magic happen ðŸŽ©!



What about layer styles?
Layer styles are coming soon! Stay tuned!
